* 3.0.0 - Apr 17 2018
- Add unit tests for lots of different version scenarios
- Add support for versions which contain one or more "release number", e.x. 1.5.7-14 has "release number" 14.
- Add support for versions with an Epoch, e.x. "5:1.7" is greater than "4:2.5" or "2.5" because of Epoch=5. Default Epoch is 0

* 2.1.1 - Jun 4 2017
- Add a lot of comments explaining what is going on
- Rename some variables to make things more clear

* 2.0.0 - Mar 23 2016
- Add VersionString
- Switch example "cmp" method which is not supported in python3 to using key=VersionString which works in either.
- Address issue where a version '.9' did not equal '0.9', by inserting an implicit '0' into comparison before or after head/tail dot
- Force string in cmp_version to that integer versions don't mess up comparison, and VersionString doesn't recurse
