        cmp_version - Compare two strings which contain versions, checking which one represents a "newer" (greater) release.

        Note that even if two version strings are not equal string-wise, they may still be equal version-wise (e.x. 1.0.0 is the same version as 1.0)

        @param version1 <str> - A string containing a version
        @param version2 <str> - A string containing a version

        @return <int>
            -1  if version1 is older/less than version2
            0   if version1 is equal to version2
            1   if version1 is newer/greater than version2

        So for example,

            cmp_version('1.0.5b', '1.0.5a') would return 1 because 1.0.5b comes after 1.0.5a
